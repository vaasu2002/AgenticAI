The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.\",\n",

Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity.
